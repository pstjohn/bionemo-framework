# TransformerEngine-accelerated Llama 3 training with native PyTorch training loop

This folder demonstrates how to train TE-accelerated Llama 3 with a native PyTorch training loop, including sequence
packing and FP8 precision, using fully sharded data parallel (FSDP) for distributed training. This recipe is configured
for genomic sequences using a custom nucleotide tokenizer.

## How to use this recipe

This folder contains an independent, minimal training example. It does not depend on any other code in the top-level
bionemo-framework repository. You can download a zipped directory of this folder alone by clicking

We compared the performance and convergence of this Llama3 recipe (with FSDP2) against NeMo 2.0
(https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/NeMo) and the [facebookresearch/lingua](https://github.com/facebookresearch/lingua)
implementation on the DCLM Baseline 1.0 dataset. See [Training on Natural Language Data (Lingua
Reproduction)](#lingua-reproduction) for more details. The figure above shows similar loss convergence and step time to
the NeMo 2.0 training example, and the following table shows downstream performance on various tasks using the
[lm-eval](github.com/eleutherai/lm-evaluation-harness) library. The variation in training step time every 10,000 steps
are due checkpointing, further work will be done to improve training step time stability.

### Distributed Training

This recipe supports distributed training using DDP, FSDP2, and FSDP2 with Context Parallelism, shown in three separate training entrypoints:

- [Distributed Data Parallel (DDP)](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel.html), shown in `train_ddp.py`
- [Fully Sharded Data Parallel 2 (FSDP2)](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributed.fsdp.fully_shard.html), shown in `train_fsdp2.py`
- FSDP2 with Context Parallelism, shown in `train_fsdp2_cp.py`

## Commands to Launch Training

To run single-process training on one GPU, run:

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py  # or train_ddp.py
```

To run multi-process training locally on 2+ GPUs, run (e.g. 2 GPUs):

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 train_fsdp2.py  # or train_ddp.py
```

Multi-Node training is supported with both strategies.

A convergence test configuration (`L0_convergence`) is also available, which uses a tiny Llama model
to verify that the training loop can overfit on a small dataset:

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_convergence
```

Gradient accumulation is supported with both strategies. To enable gradient accumulation, set `grad_acc_steps` to the
number of steps to accumulate gradients before updating the model parameters. This is useful to scale the effective
batch size while running on a smaller number of GPUs.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity grad_acc_steps=2
```

### FP8 Training

To run training with FP8, enable it by overriding the `fp8_config.enabled=true` configuration parameter. Additional FP8
configuration parameters, including switching to `MXFP8BlockScaling`, can be set via the hydra configuration.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity fp8_config.enabled=true
```

#### FP8 Debugging

We also provide a mechanism to receive tensor data related to FP8 layers during training which may include activations, weights and gradients.

To enable this please select the following config options.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py \
  fp8_stats_config.enabled=True \
  fp8_stats_config.fp8_log_dir=./logs/fp8_stats_logs_dummy \
  fp8_stats_config.fp8_stats_file=./fp8_debugging_stats.yaml \
  fp8_config.enabled=True
```

Note: This feature is available for the `train_ddp` and the `train_fsdp2` scripts.

The config file structure [fp8_debugging_stats.yaml](fp8_debugging_stats.yaml) is explained in the [NVIDIA Transformer Engine config file documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/debug/2_config_file_structure.html) in more detail. Below we will cover some very basic elements of the file structure.

This comes as a performance cost that is dependent on the `freq` parameter mentioned above. `freq=1` collects stats on every step which in our
experiments caused a ~29% decrease in throughput (executed on a single RTX 5090). We recommend using `freq>=10` to reduce this performance hit.

### Sequence Packing (THD input format)

Sequence packing is handled via a padding-free collator (in `collator.py`) that provides input arguments (e.g.
`cu_seq_lens_q`) needed for padding-free attention. To enable sequence packing, set `use_sequence_packing=true`
in the hydra configuration.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity use_sequence_packing=true
```

### FP8 and Sequence Packing

To combine FP8 training with sequence packing, the number of unpadded input tokens must be a multiple of 16. The data
collator will automatically pad packed sequences to the maximum number of tokens per batch.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity \
  fp8_config.enabled=true \
  use_sequence_packing=true
```

### Context Parallel Training

Context parallelism splits each sequence across multiple GPUs along the sequence dimension, enabling training with very
long sequences. Use `train_fsdp2_cp.py` with the `L0_sanity_cp` configuration and set `cp_size` to the number of context
parallelism ranks. Works with both BSHD (no padding) and THD (padding) input formats. Only TE models are supported.

```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=4 train_fsdp2_cp.py --config-name L0_sanity_cp cp_size=2
```

## Downloading Pre-Training Data For Offline Training

This recipe is configured to use genomic sequences. The default configuration uses a local test file
`test_genomic_sequences.parquet`.

For large-scale training, you can point the dataset configuration to a directory containing Parquet files or a Hugging
Face dataset, e.g., for the DCLM Baseline 1.0 dataset:

```bash
hf download mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0 \
 --repo-type dataset --include 'global-shard_01_of_10/*' \
 --local-dir /path/to/download/directory

python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity \
  dataset.load_dataset_kwargs.path=/path/to/download/directory
```

## Training on Natural Language Data (Lingua Reproduction) {#lingua-reproduction}

We provide a configuration to reproduce the Llama-3.2-1B training experiments from [Meta
Lingua](https://github.com/facebookresearch/lingua), using the [DCLM Baseline
1.0](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0) dataset.

To launch this training, use the `L2_lingua_1b` configuration:

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L2_lingua_1b
```

This configuration:

- Uses the `meta-llama/Llama-3-8B` tokenizer (requires Hugging Face login).
- Streams the `mlfoundations/dclm-baseline-1.0` dataset.
- Sets up training parameters to match the Lingua 1B baseline.

Note: Ensure you have authenticated with Hugging Face (`huggingface-cli login`) to access the tokenizer if it requires
gated access, or update the config to use a public Llama 3 tokenizer.

## Saving and Loading Checkpoints

To enable checkpoint saving, ensure that `checkpoint.ckpt_dir` is set to a writable directory. Checkpointing frequency is
controlled by the `checkpoint.save_every_n_steps` configuration parameter.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity \
  checkpoint.ckpt_dir=/path/to/ckpt_dir \
  checkpoint.save_every_n_steps=100
```

To enable checkpoint loading, set `checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true` to resume from the latest checkpoint.

```bash
python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity \
  checkpoint.ckpt_dir=/path/to/ckpt_dir \
  checkpoint.resume_from_checkpoint=true
```

We also show how to export a final model at the end of training, which is suitable for uploading to the Hugging Face Hub
or for local inference as a more durable format than torch distributed checkpoints. To enable this, set
`checkpoint.save_final_model=true` in the hydra configuration. The resulting model will be saved to the `final_model`
directory within the checkpoint directory.

## Saving Dataloader State with `StatefulDataLoader`

These examples show how to save and resume your dataloader by passing the dataloader instance to our `save_checkpoint_*`
and `load_checkpoint_*` functions using the `StatefulDataLoader` class from `torchdata`. See `checkpoint.py` for
implementation details.

## Performance Profiling with NVIDIA Nsight Systems

This recipe includes built-in support for profiling with NVIDIA Nsight Systems, which provides detailed performance
traces including CUDA kernels, CPU activities, memory operations, and NVTX ranges. The profiler allows you to specify
the exact training step range to profile.

### Basic Usage (Single GPU)

To profile a training run on a single GPU:

```bash
nsys profile \
  -o nsight_trace \
  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt,cudnn,cublas \
  --pytorch=autograd-nvtx \
  --capture-range=cudaProfilerApi \
  --capture-range-end=stop \
  python train_fsdp2.py \
    profiler.enabled=true \
    profiler.start_step=10 \
    profiler.end_step=15
```

**Profiler Configuration Parameters:**

- `profiler.enabled`: Enable/disable profiling (default: false)
- `profiler.start_step`: Training step at which to start profiling (default: 10)
- `profiler.end_step`: Training step at which to end profiling (default: 15)

**Nsight Systems Flags:**

- `--pytorch=autograd-nvtx`: Adds NVTX markers for PyTorch autograd operations (forward/backward passes, optimizer steps). This helps visualize the training loop structure and identify bottlenecks in the computation graph.
- `--pytorch-backtrace=cuda`: Captures Python backtraces for CUDA kernel launches, helping identify which Python code triggered each kernel. This is invaluable for debugging performance issues and understanding which operations are expensive.
- `--python-sampling=true` (optional): Periodically samples Python call stacks to identify CPU-side bottlenecks. Useful when investigating data loading, preprocessing, or Python overhead. Adds ~5-15% overhead, so only use when needed.

**Note**: The PyTorch-specific flags (`--pytorch=autograd-nvtx` and `--pytorch-backtrace=cuda`) add minimal overhead but provide significantly more detailed insights into PyTorch operations, making them highly recommended for training workload profiling. Use `--python-sampling=true` only when investigating CPU/Python performance.

The profiler will start capturing performance data at `start_step` and stop at `end_step`. It's recommended to start profiling after a few steps to allow training to stabilize.

### Multi-GPU Profiling

For distributed training, **profiling is only performed on global rank 0** to minimize overhead and avoid redundant data
collection. Other ranks will skip profiling automatically.

#### Multi-GPU on Single Node

```bash
nsys profile \
  -o nsight_trace_rank0 \
  --trace=cuda,nvtx,osrt,cudnn,cublas \
  --pytorch=autograd-nvtx \
  --pytorch-backtrace=cuda \
  --capture-range=cudaProfilerApi \
  --capture-range-end=stop \
  torchrun --nproc_per_node=2 train_fsdp2.py \
    profiler.enabled=true
```

For more information on Nsight Systems, see the [official documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/).

## Running Inference with the Trained Model

Models can be loaded from the final checkpoint directory using the `AutoModelForCausalLM` method (or
`NVLlamaForCausalLM` if using TE layers directly, though standard HF loading works if the `config.json` is updated to
include an `auto_map` entry for `modeling_llama_te.NVLlamaForCausalLM` and the custom forward pass is packaged in the
checkpoint directory).

If you trained with TE layers (which is the default in this recipe), you can use the `NVLlamaForCausalLM` class for
inference, which supports high-performance generation with TE-provided `InferenceParams` key-value cache class.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from transformer_engine.pytorch.attention import InferenceParams
from modeling_llama_te import NVLlamaForCausalLM, NVLlamaConfig

# Load the model configuration and weights
config = NVLlamaConfig.from_pretrained("path/to/final_model")
model = NVLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/final_model", config=config)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./tokenizers/nucleotide_fast_tokenizer")

model.to("cuda")
model.eval()

# Example genomic sequence
sequence = "ACGTACGT"
inputs = tokenizer(sequence, return_tensors="pt").to("cuda")

# Setup inference parameters for efficient generation
past_key_values = InferenceParams(
    max_batch_size=1,
    max_sequence_length=256,
    num_heads_kv=model.config.num_key_value_heads,
    head_dim_k=model.config.hidden_size // model.config.num_attention_heads,
    dtype=torch.bfloat16,
    qkv_format="thd",
    max_ctx_len=256,
)

for layer_number in range(1, model.config.num_hidden_layers + 1):
    past_key_values.allocate_memory(layer_number)

# Generate
with torch.no_grad():
    output_ids = model.generate(
        **inputs, max_new_tokens=16, use_cache=True, past_key_values=past_key_values
    )

generated_text = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(generated_text)
```

### Converting to Hugging Face Format

If you want to convert the trained TE model back to a standard Hugging Face `LlamaForCausalLM` (e.g., to use with vLLM
or SGLang), you can use the provided conversion script in `../../models/llama3/convert.py`.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer
from modeling_llama_te import NVLlamaForCausalLM, NVLlamaConfig
from convert import convert_llama_te_to_hf  # Import from ../../models/llama3/convert.py

# Load TE model
config = NVLlamaConfig.from_pretrained("path/to/final_model")
model_te = NVLlamaForCausalLM.from_pretrained("path/to/final_model", config=config)

# Convert to HF
model_hf = convert_llama_te_to_hf(model_te)

# Save HF model
model_hf.save_pretrained("path/to/hf_converted_model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("./tokenizers/nucleotide_fast_tokenizer")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("path/to/hf_converted_model")
```

Once converted, the model can be loaded by any library that supports Llama 3, such as
[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) or [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).

```bash
# Example vLLM usage
vllm serve path/to/hf_converted_model
```

## Developer Guide

### Running tests

To run tests locally, run `recipes_local_test.py` from the repository root with the recipe directory as an argument.

```bash
./ci/scripts/recipes_local_test.py bionemo-recipes/recipes/llama3_native_te/
```

### Development container

To use the provided devcontainer, use "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" from the VSCode menu, and choose the
"BioNeMo Recipes Dev Container" option. To run the tests inside the container, run `pytest -v .` in the recipe
directory.

### Hydra Tips

[Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) is a powerful configuration management library for Python. This recipe uses Hydra to manage
training configurations, allowing for easy modification of training hyper-parameters and model settings.

Configuration parameters can be overridden from the command line, e.g.
`python train_fsdp2.py --config-name L0_sanity fp8_config.enabled=true`.
