# PEFT Fine-tuning with TransformerEngine-accelerated ESM-2

This folder demonstrates how to fine-tune a TransformerEngine-accelerated ESM-2 model using PEFT.

Note: This recipe is a work in progress, and currently only demonstrates basic support for LoRA fine-tuning and
TransformerEngine layers. Refer to `bionemo-recipes/models/esm2/tests/test_peft.py` for additional information and known
limitations.
