# 4. Pre-install local sub-packages if checked out by CI.
#    pyproject.toml references bionemo-recipeutils and bionemo-core from git (main).
#    In CI, the workflow sparse-checks them out alongside this recipe so we can test
#    against the PR's changes. But if the sub-packages don't exist on main yet (e.g.
#    a new package introduced in the PR), uv's git source resolution fails and the
#    entire recipe install is aborted — leaving ALL deps (megatron-bridge, etc.)
#    uninstalled. By pre-installing from local and temporarily removing their git
#    source entries, the subsequent recipe install sees them as already satisfied and
#    only needs to resolve the remaining deps normally.
