### CI Pipeline Configuration

Configure CI behavior by applying the relevant labels. By default, only basic unit tests are run.

- [ciflow:skip](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/blob/main/docs/docs/main/contributing/contributing.md#ciflow:skip) - Skip all CI tests for this PR
- [ciflow:notebooks](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/blob/main/docs/docs/main/contributing/contributing.md#ciflow:notebooks) - Run Jupyter notebooks execution tests for bionemo2
- [ciflow:slow](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/blob/main/docs/docs/main/contributing/contributing.md#ciflow:slow) - Run slow single GPU integration tests marked as @pytest.mark.slow for bionemo2
- [ciflow:all](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/blob/main/docs/docs/main/contributing/contributing.md#ciflow:all) - Run all tests (unit tests, slow tests, and notebooks) for bionemo2. This label can be used to enforce running tests for all bionemo2.
- [ciflow:all-recipes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/bionemo-framework/blob/main/docs/docs/main/contributing/contributing.md#ciflow:all-recipes) - Run tests for all recipes (under bionemo-recipes). This label can be used to enforce running tests for all recipes.

Unit tests marked as `@pytest.mark.multi_gpu` or `@pytest.mark.distributed` are not run in the PR pipeline.

> [!NOTE]
> By default, only basic unit tests are run. Add appropriate labels to enable an additional test coverage.

#### Authorizing CI Runs

We use [copy-pr-bot](https://docs.gha-runners.nvidia.com/apps/copy-pr-bot/#automation) to manage authorization of CI
runs on NVIDIA's compute resources.

- If a pull request is opened by a trusted user and contains only trusted changes, the pull request's code will
  automatically be copied to a pull-request/ prefixed branch in the source repository (e.g. pull-request/123)
- If a pull request is opened by an untrusted user or contains untrusted changes, an NVIDIA org member must leave an
  `/ok to test` comment on the pull request to trigger CI. This will need to be done for each new commit.

#### Triggering Code Rabbit AI Review

To trigger a code review from code rabbit, comment on a pull request with one of these commands:

- @coderabbitai review - Triggers a standard review
- @coderabbitai full review - Triggers a comprehensive review

See https://docs.coderabbit.ai/reference/review-commands for a full list of commands.
