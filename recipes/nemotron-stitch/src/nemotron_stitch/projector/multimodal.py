"""MultimodalProjector: the named projector registry (design §3.1–§3.3).

Moved from ct-nemotron's ``conditioning/router.py``: same validation and
dispatch, with the internals lowered to the flat index contract (design §3.2).
One behavior is deliberately tightened: the old router's mixed mode (explicit
indices for some adapters, placeholder derivation for others) dereferenced a
None and crashed; here indices are either explicit for every projector or
derived for all of them.

    ``projector_ownership="sidecar"`` (default): the host holds the registry
    outside its module tree (``object.__setattr__``), so framework state-dict
    conversion, FSDP2 wrapping, and PEFT freezing never see it; the registry
    therefore owns device placement and coerces incoming features to its
    parameters' device and dtype at the forward boundary. Fails closed above
    one rank — that guard lives in the consumer's recipe.

    ``projector_ownership="module"``: the host registers the registry as an
    ordinary child module, so FSDP2/DTensor wrapping, the host's
    ``initialize_weights`` extension, and the trainability policy all see it.
    Device placement is then owned by that wrapping (and by the consumer's TP
    plumbing for a replicated projector), so a feature payload on the wrong
    device is a wiring bug: module mode fails closed on device mismatch rather
    than silently moving data — a ``.to()`` cannot repair DTensor placements
    anyway. For a single projector this is a one-entry ``ModuleDict``.
