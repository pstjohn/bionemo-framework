"""One resolver for the language-model width of a host config.

The training path (``automodel/model.py``) and the serving path
(``vllm/plugin.py``) must agree on the LM width of the same model: a
disagreement is a wrong-width projector that the vLLM hidden-size check
rejects only at rollout, after alignment and SFT have already run. Host
configs carry the width in one of three places — plain ``hidden_size``,
``text_config.hidden_size``, or ``llm_config.hidden_size`` — so both
integrations resolve it here and nowhere else. Stdlib-only; imported lazily
by the framework integrations (design §3.7).
