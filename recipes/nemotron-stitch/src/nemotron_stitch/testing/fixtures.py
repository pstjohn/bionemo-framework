"""Synthetic ragged batches for the flat index contract (design §3.2).

The flat contract exists because of packed streams: one batch row holds
several records, each contributing a different number of soft tokens. Neither
consumer's real collator produces that at this layer — ct-nemotron's emits a
rectangular ``[B, T]`` grid — so the ragged fixture is synthetic. It carries
uneven per-row token counts, one row with no soft tokens at all, and
non-contiguous target positions, in both the flat and dense (``-1`` padded)
spellings, plus the expected scatter result built by hand.
