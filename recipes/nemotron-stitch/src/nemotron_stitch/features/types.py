"""FeatureRef, EncoderOutput, and the Unit protocol (design §7).

An encoder consumes a sequence of consumer-defined *elements* (the consumer
owns the alphabet) addressed in *units*: the encoder-facing granularity that
chunking, coverage, and pooling count in. ``Unit`` is the protocol a consumer
enum implements to expose the element→unit conversion. ``FeatureRef`` is the
content-addressed identity of one source record; ``EncoderOutput`` is the
``[units, hidden]`` result with per-unit coverage.
