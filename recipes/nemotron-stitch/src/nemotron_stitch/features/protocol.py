"""FrozenEncoder Protocol (design §7).

The frozen upstream encoder (LLaVA's "vision tower"): constructed from a
locked :class:`~nemotron_stitch.features.registry.EncoderSpec`, it maps
consumer source sequences to unit-aligned :class:`EncoderOutput` rows. The
sequence type is the consumer's own (it owns the alphabet and unit enum), so
the protocol is generic over it.
