"""The soft-token prompt renderer: ``start + placeholder * count + end`` runs in a template.

One renderer for every surface that turns soft-token prompts into text — the
training collator and the RL processor must render byte-identically, or the
warm start silently degrades into a mediocre reward curve. Stdlib-only and
importable from the base package (no framework import, no modality name).

Multi-projector by construction: embedding several modalities at once is
the point of the package, and a single-projector renderer is exactly the API
that would need replacing the first time two encoders share one prompt. The
caller supplies a template carrying one marker per projector that received
features — ``{mm:<name>}`` — so interleaved prompts render in text order while
scatter routing stays by token identity (design §3.1). A single projector is
the degenerate case.

The renderer emits text, not token ids: placeholder-id checks stay in the RL
processor and in ``MultimodalProjector``, and ``derive_indices`` re-checks the
run-length invariant at the scatter boundary.
