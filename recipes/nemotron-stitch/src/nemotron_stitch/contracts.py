"""Shared contract constants for the package and its consumers.

The schema version and format discriminator are recorded in every manifest
and checked on load, so a checkpoint written by an older package fails loudly
rather than silently mis-scattering (design §8). Bumping ``SCHEMA_VERSION``
requires shipping a converter for the previous version in the same change
(AGENTS.md).

# The on-disk format discriminator keeps the pre-rename package name: it is an
