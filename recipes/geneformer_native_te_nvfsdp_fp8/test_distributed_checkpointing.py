"""Test suite for distributed checkpointing functionality.

This module tests checkpoint save/resume functionality across different
distributed training configurations:
- nvFSDP (Native Fully Sharded Data Parallel) with 1 and 2 processes
- DDP (Distributed Data Parallel) with 1 and 2 processes

Test Strategy:
1. Phase 1: Train for N steps and save checkpoint
2. Phase 2: Resume training from checkpoint and continue
3. Validate: Checkpoints created, resuming works, training continues seamlessly

Each test uses temporary directories and disables wandb logging for isolation.
