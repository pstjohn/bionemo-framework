    "# BioNeMo - Geneformer inferencing for single cell downstream tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases how to run the BioNeMo container, pre-train a geneformer model, and use it for inferencing downstream single cell tasks. At the end of this tutorial, a user will learn:\n",
    "- launching the BioNeMo container\n",
    "- Download data from czi to use for pre-training and inference.\n",
    "- Convert AnnData files into the sparse SCDL memmap format used by BioNeMo\n",
    "- Kick-off pretraining with a custom single cell dataset\n",
    "- Restore the pre-trained model and perform inference with the same czi dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "First, we must acquire single cell training data for inference. To do this we will install the cellxgene-census api and download a small dataset. We use the example provided by the czi api examples page to download a single h5ad file. Generally, our workflow expects a collection of h5ad files to be used for pre-training. In this case, we restrict to 100k cells from a single dataset  to keep training time and downloading time small."
